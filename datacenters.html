		<h2>What is a Data Center?</h2>
			<p>Content Provided by Cisco
			<p>At its simplest, a data center is a physical facility that organizations use to house their critical applications and data. A data center's design is based on a network of computing and storage resources that enable the delivery of shared applications and data. The key components of a data center design include routers, switches, firewalls, storage systems, servers, and application-delivery controllers.
			
		<h3>Why are data centers important to business?</h3>
			<p>In the world of enterprise IT, data centers are designed to support business applications and activities that include:
				<ul>
					<li>Email and file sharing
					<li>Productivity applications
					<li>Customer relationship management (CRM)
					<li>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and databases
					<li>Big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning
					<li>Virtual desktops, communications and collaboration services
				</ul>
				
		<h3>What are the core components of a data center?</h3>
			<p>Data center design includes routers, switches, firewalls, storage systems, servers, and application delivery controllers. Because these components store and manage business-critical data and applications, data center security is critical in data center design. Together, they provide:
			<p>Network infrastructure. This connects servers (physical and virtualized), data center services, storage, and external connectivity to end-user locations.
			<p>Storage infrastructure. Data is the fuel of the modern data center. Storage systems are used to hold this valuable commodity.
			<p>Computing resources. Applications are the engines of a data center. These servers provide the processing, memory, local storage, and network connectivity that drive applications.
